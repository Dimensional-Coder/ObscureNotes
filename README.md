# Obscure Notes
By Dim

## About
Obscure Notes lets you store memos or text on a publicly accessible site. Anyone can access your notes if they happen to know what keywords you used to navigate to your note page. Thus, your data is hidden by obscurity.

## How does it work?
The user selects a set of keywords to identify "where" they want to store their memos. The keywords are used as a key to encrypt and decrypt the user's text. The key never leaves the user's browser, meaning the server database never sees the unencrypted data.

## Progress
The project is in very early development. Right now it's more of a playground to experiment than a functioning project.

## Development Setup
- npm i
- npm run bundle
- npm run start
