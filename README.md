By Dim

Obscure Notes can be used at https://obscurenotes.herokuapp.com/ !

## About
Obscure Notes lets you store memos or text on a publicly accessible site. Anyone can access your notes if they happen to know what keywords you used to navigate to your note page. Thus, your data is hidden by obscurity.

## How does it work?
The user selects a set of keywords to identify "where" they want to store their memos. The keywords are used as a key to encrypt and decrypt the user's text. The key never leaves the user's browser, meaning the server database never sees the unencrypted data.

## Progress
The project is complete and working! I'd like to return to the project and add more features in the future.

## Development Setup
- npm i
- npm run bundle
- npm run start
